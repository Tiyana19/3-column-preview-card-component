### What I learned

I learned more about CSS grid. I also got to know plus points of auto value to width and height.
Thank you so much @CyrusKabir for telling me my mistakes.
I stoped hover from increasing card's height over hover by giving a default border to buttton with transparent color.
also because of CSS Specificity color property over hover works fine.

### Continued development

I need to pay more attention to media query. and try to make website more responsive.
